## Features

- **Interactive Block-Based Interface**: Drag and drop code blocks to create and visualize programs.
- **Educational Tools**: Simplified syntax and clear error messages to aid learning.
- **Customizable Workspaces**: Users can add, remove, and update code blocks in a dynamic workspace.
- **Output Display**: View the results of executed code blocks in real-time.
